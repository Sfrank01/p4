When setting configurations, remember that any app is also impacted by the configurations found in /core/config/config.php;
Most of the core configs can be overwritten here on the app level.

For example there's a constant in core config set for TIME_FORMAT

	if(!defined('TIME_FORMAT')) define('TIME_FORMAT', 'F j, Y g:ia'); 

If you want a different default time format for this app, set it below

	define('TIME_FORMAT', 'M j Y');

A email designated to receive messages from the server. Examples:
 	* When there's a MySQL error on the live server it will send it to this email
 	* If you're BCCing yourself on outgoing emails you may want them to go there
 	* Logs, cron results, errors, etc.
 	
 	Some might want this to be the same as the APP_EMAIL, others might want to create a designated gmail address for it
